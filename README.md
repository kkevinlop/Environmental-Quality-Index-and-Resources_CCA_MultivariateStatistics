# Environmental Quality Index and Resources - CCA Multivariate Statistics

### Overview
Environmental quality and resource 
management are pivotal for sustainable development, especially 
in developing countries like Indonesia. This study applies 
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to examine the 
relationships between environmental quality indicators (IKLH) 
and environmental resources (SDL) using 2023 data from Badan 
Pusat Statistik (BPS). The IKLH variables include air quality 
(IKU), water quality (IKA), and soil quality (IKTL), while the 
SDL variables encompass the productivity of rice (PP), corn 
(PJ), and peanuts (PKT). The analysis identifies the first 
canonical function as significant, with a canonical correlation 
coefficient of 0.708 and a squared correlation of 0.501, 
explaining 50.1% of the variability between the two variable sets. 
The results highlight that water quality (IKA) and rice 
productivity (PP) are the most influential factors, with canonical 
loadings of 0.980 and 0.714, respectively. These findings indicate 
a strong interdependence between environmental quality and 
agricultural productivity, emphasizing the need for policies that 
enhance water quality and agricultural outputs to improve 
overall environmental and socio-economic conditions.

The canonical loadings indicate the correlation between the 
original variables and the canonical variates. For the first 
canonical function, IKA (Indeks Kualitas Air) has the highest 
loading of 0.980, indicating a very strong correlation with the 
canonical variate. This confirms the result from the canonical 
weights, where IKA was also the most influential variable in 
the IKLH group. IKTL (Indeks Kualitas Tutupan Lahan) also 
has a high loading of 0.784, indicating a strong positive 
correlation with the canonical variate. IKU (Indeks Kualitas 
Udara) has a moderate loading of 0.720.
In the SDL group, Padi (Produktivitas Padi) and 
KacangTanah (Produktivitas Kacang Tanah) have strong 
loadings of 0.714 and 0.683, respectively, indicating they are 
strongly correlated with the canonical variate. Jagung 
(Produktivitas Jagung) has a very low loading of 0.090, 
suggesting it is not significantly correlated with the canonical 
variate.
Overall, the canonical loadings reinforce the findings from 
the canonical weights. In the IKLH group, the quality of water 
(IKA) is the most influential variable, followed by the quality 
of land cover (IKTL) and air quality (IKU). In the SDL group, 
the productivity of padi and kacang tanah are the most 
influential variables, with padi having a slightly higher 
influence
